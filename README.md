## Weather App

This is a weather application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It fetches real-time weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

### Features

* Shows location information (city, country)
* Option to search for weather in different locations

### Technologies Used

* Frontend:
    * HTML:  for structuring the content
    * CSS: for styling the application
    * JavaScript: for fetching weather data and manipulating the DOM

### How it Works

1. The HTML file provides the basic structure of the application.
2. The CSS file styles the various elements in the HTML.
3. The JavaScript code interacts with the weather API to fetch weather data for the specified location.
4. Once the data is received, the JavaScript manipulates the DOM to display the weather information on the webpage.
